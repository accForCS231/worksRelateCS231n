naive version of code means doing vector operations elementwise with loops or so,
while vectorized codes do vector operations directly based on vectors.
However we do not distinguish between these to styles of coding in this version

	Softmax loss function, naive implementation (with loops)

	Inputs have dimension D, there are C classes, and we operate on minibatches

	- W: A numpy array of shape (D, C) containing weights.
	- X: A numpy array of shape (N, D) containing a minibatch of data.
	- y: A numpy array of shape (N,) containing training labels; y[i] = c means
		that X[i] has label c, where 0 <= c < C.
	- reg: (float) regularization strength

	Returns a tuple of:
	- loss as single float
	- gradient with respect to weights W; an array of same shape as W
